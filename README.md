## 🔍 Project Overview

The main project in this repository performs an **analysis of economic indicators** for Iran from **1960 to 2024**. Using Python and common data science libraries, the notebook aims to:

✔ Load and explore historical economic data
✔ Clean and preprocess the dataset
✔ Visualize trends in key economic indicators
✔ Derive insights about economic growth, inflation, industries, etc. (as applicable)
✔ (Optional) Apply simple models to forecast or interpret trends

This is a useful project for beginners and intermediate learners looking to practice **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and basic machine learning workflows.
